
NOTE: React leafet and SSR do not play well together. As such, in the build version, the map is unable to be changed without reloading.

If you download this repository, you can comment out SearchMapWithNoSSR component and uncomment out SearchMap. This will allow for map functionality in dev mode, but next will not be able to build a production version.
